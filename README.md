# Automated DFA Minimiser
~~One Day Coding Challenge.~~
In my Compilers and Code Generation module, we do some work with minimizing DFA's generated from the
subset construct. As the course is centered around the motto 'can we write a program to do it', I 
thought I'd give it a go.

Extended to a Week Coding Challenge

# How to use
As args input, input the following (with spaces to seperate):

1. Enter the numbers of the accepting states
2. Enter a comma
3. Enter the remaining non-accepting states

Once the program runs, follow the on-screen instructions...

# Example Input
./minimiser 1 2 3 , 4 0


# Potential Updates
1. Point out accepting states
2. Tidy up final input
